            A group is a set \(G\) equipped with an operation, called a group product, that associates each ordered pair \((a,b)\) of elements of \(G\) with an element \(ab\) of \(G\) in a way that:
            (1) for any elements \( a,b,c \in G\), \((ab)c = a(bc) \);
            (2) there is a unique element \( e \in G \) such that \(ae=a=ae\) for any element \(a \in G\);
            (3) for each \(a \in G\) there is an element \(a^{-1} \in G\) such that \(a^{-1}a = e = aa^{-1}\). 
            To be percise, the group product is a mapping \( \mu \colon G \times G \rightarrow G \), and the group is denoted as the pair \((G,\mu)\) to disambiguate groups with different products on the same underlying set.

            A semigroup is a set \(S\) that satisfies group axiom (1) which is known as the associativity axiom.

            Let \(S\) be the set of all mappings from a given set X to itself. Suppose there are maps \(f,g,h \in S \). Let \(b = h \circ g\), and \( a = g \circ f \). 
            We have 
            \( ((h \circ g) \circ f)(x) = (b \circ f)(x) = b(f(x)) = h(g(f(x)) = h(a(x)) = (h \circ a)(x) =  (h \circ (g \circ f))(x) \).
            Thus composition is associative.
            Hence the set of all mappings from a given set to itself under the product of set composition is a semigroup ☯
        <p>
            Let \(S\) be the be the set of all one-to-one correspondences from a given set X to itself.  
            There exists a map \(e \in S\) such that \(e(a) = a\) for all \(a \in S\).
            Let \( \pi \) be any map in \(S\). By composition, \( (\pi \circ e)(x) = \pi(e(x)) = \pi(x) = e(\pi(x) = (e \circ \pi)(x)\)
            Thus group axiom (2) which is known as the identiy axiom is satisfied.
            A one-to-one correspondence is also known as a bijection. Bijections are invertible maps; i.e., for any map \(a \in S\) there exists a map \(a^{-1} \in Y\) such that \(aa^{-1} = e = a^{-1}a \).
            Thus group axiom (3) which is known as the inverse axiom is satisfied.  
            By the previous paragraph, associativity is inherieted.
            Hence the set of all one-to-one correspondences of a set with itself forms a group under composition ☯

            Let \(S\) be a semigroup with an element \(e\) such that \(ea=a=ae\) for all \(a \in S\).
            Suppose that there exists an element \(e' \in S\) such that \(ae' = a = e'a\).
            We have \( e = ee' = (ee')e = e'e = e' \). Hence the identity element is unique. ☯
        <p>    
            This indicates that the word "unique" in the identity axiom is superflous.

            Let \(S\) be a semigroup with an element \(e\) such that \(ea = a\) for all \(a \in S\) and such that for every \(a \in S\) there exists \(a^{-1} \in S\) for which \(a^{-1}a=e\).
            We have \(a^{-1} = a^{-1}aa^{-1}\) and also \(e=(a^{-1})^{-1}a^{-1} \).
            By substitution, associativity, and the given properties: \(e=(a^{-1})^{-1}(a^{-1}aa^{-1}) = e=((a^{-1})^{-1}a^{-1})(aa^{-1}) = eaa^{-1} = aa^{-1}\).
            Thus we have both left and right inverses.
            Since we have \(a^{-1}a = aa^{-1} \), we are allowed \(ae = aa^{-1}a = ae\). Thus we have left and right identity. Hence S is a group. ☯

            Let \(S\) be a semigroup with finitely many elements. Suppose left and right cancellation laws hold; i.e., if \(ab = ac\) or \(ba = ca\), then \(b=c\).
            Equivalently, if \(b \neq c \), then \(ab \neq ac\) and \(ba \neq ca\).
            Since there are \(n\) distinct elements \(\in\) \(S\), there must be \(n\) distinct products: \( x_1a, \dots, x_{n}a \in S\), and also: \( ax_1, \dots, ax_{n} \in S\). 
            We must have \( \{ ax_1, \dots, ax_{n}a\} = S = \{ x_1a, \dots, x_{n}a\} \) for every \( a \in S \).
            Since \(S\) can be left and right factored by every \(a\), there is some element \(e=xe\) for some

            i.e., \(e=a^{-1}a\), \(e=aa^{-1}\) for some \(a^{-1} \in S\).

            Let \(G\) be a group. Define a new product operation on G by \(a*b := ba\) for any \(a,b \in G\). Let \(G^{*}\) denote the set G with the new product.
            We have assoacitivity: \((a*b)*c = (ba)*c = cba = a*(cb) = a*(b*c)\),
            identity is preserved: \(a*e = ea = a = ae = e*a \),
            and so are inverses: \(a*a^{-1} = a^{-1}a = e = aa^{-1} = a^{-1}*a\).
            Thus \(G^{*}\) satisfies the group axioms. ☯
        <p>
            \(G^{*}\) is known as the opposite group to \(G\).

            Let \(G\) and \(G'\) be groups. Define a new product on \(G \times G'\) by \((a,a')(b,b') := (ab, a'b')\).
            We have associativity: \(((a,a')(b,b'))(c,c') = (ac,a'b')(c,c') = (abc,a'b'c') = (a,a')(bc,b'c') = (a,a')((b,b')(c,c')))\),

                and inverses: \((a,a')(a^{-1},a'^{-1}) = (aa^{-1}, a'a'^{-1}) = (e,e')\).
            Thus \(G \times G'\) is a group under the product. ☯

            \(G \times G' \) is called the direct product of \(G\) and \(G'\).
