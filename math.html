            A group is a set \(G\) equipped with an operation, called a group product, that associates each ordered pair \((a,b)\) of elements of \(G\) with an element \(ab\) of \(G\) in a way that:
            (1) for any elements \( a,b,c \in G\), \((ab)c = a(bc) \);
            (2) there is a unique element \( e \in G \) such that \(ae=a=ae\) for any element \(a \in G\);
            (3) for each \(a \in G\) there is an element \(a^{-1} \in G\) such that \(a^{-a}a = e = aa^{-1}\). 
            Formally, the group product is a mapping \( \mu \colon G \times G \rightarrow G \), and the group is denoted as the pair \((G,\mu)\) to disambiguate groups with different products on the same underlying set.
        <p>
            A semigroup is a set \(S\) that satisfies group axiom (1) which is known as the associativity axiom.

            Let S be the set of all mappings from a given set X to itself. Suppose maps \(f,g,h \in S \). Let \(b = h \circ g\), and \( a = g \circ f \). 
            We have 
            \( ((h \circ g) \circ f)(x) = (b \circ f)(x) = b(f(x)) = h(g(f(x)) = h(a(x)) = (h \circ a)(x) =  (h \circ (g \circ f))(x) \)
            Composition is associative.
            Hence, the set of all mappings from a given set to itself under the product of set composition is a semigroup ☯
        <p>
            Let S be the be the set of all one-to-one correspondences from a given set X to itself.  
            There exists a map \(e \in S\) such that \(e(a) = a\) for all \(a \in S\).
            Let \( \pi \) be any map in \(S\). By composition, \( (\pi \circ e)(x) = \pi(e(x)) = \pi(x) = e(\pi(x) = (e \circ \pi)(x)\)
            Thus, group axiom (2) which is known as the identiy axiom is satisfied.
            A one-to-one correspondence is also known as a bijection. Bijections are invertible maps i.e. for any map \(a \in S\) there exists a map \(a^{-1} \in Y\) such that \(aa^{-1} = e = a^{-1}a \).
            Thus, group axiom (3) which is known as the inverse axiom is satisfied.  
            By the previous paragraph, associativity is inherieted.
            Hence, the set of all one-to-one correspondences of a set with itself forms a group under composition ☯

            Let S be a semigroup with an element \(e\) such that \(ea=a=ae\) for all \(a \in S\).
            Suppose that there exists an element \(e' \in S\) such that \(ae' = a = e'a\).
            We have \( e = ee' = (ee')e = e'e = e' \). Hence, the identity element is unique. ☯
        <p>    
            This indicates that the word "unique" in the identity axiom is superflous.

            S is a set. Define the binary operation on S denoted \( a/b \) such that: (1) there is an element \(1 \in S \), such that \(a / b = 1 \) if and only if \( a = b\),
            and (2) for any \(a,b,c  \in  S, (a/c)/(b/c) = a/b \).
            Define a product operation denoted by juxtaposition by the rule \( ab := a/(1/b)\).
        <p>
            We have \(1a = 1/(1/a) = (a/a)/(1/a) = a/1 = a/(1/1) = a1 \)
        <p>
            Also \(a/1 = a/(a/a)\)
        <p>
            \( a(1/a) = a/(1/(1/a)) = a/((a/a)/(1/a)) = a/(a/1) \)

            \( (1/a)a = (1/a)/(1/a) = 1/1 = 1\)

            \( 11 = 1/(1/1) = 1/1 = 1 \)
