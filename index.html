            A group is a set \(G\) equipped with an operation, called a group product, that associates each ordered pair \((a,b)\) of elements of \(G\) with an element \(ab\) of \(G\) in a way that:
            (1) for any elements \( a,b,c \in G\), \((ab)c = a(bc) \);
            (2) there is a unique element \( e \in G \) such that \(ae=a=ae\) for any element \(a \in G\);
            (3) for each \(a \in G\) there is an element \(a^{-1} \in G\) such that \(a^{-1}a = e = aa^{-1}\). 
            To be percise, the group product is a mapping \( \mu \colon G \times G \rightarrow G \), and the group is denoted as the pair \((G,\mu)\) to disambiguate groups with different products on the same underlying set.
        <p>
            A semigroup is a set \(S\) that satisfies group axiom (1) which is known as the associativity axiom.
    </section>
    <section class="theorem">
        <p> 
            Let \(S\) be the set of all mappings from a given set X to itself. Suppose there are maps \(f,g,h \in S \). Let \(b = h \circ g\), and \( a = g \circ f \). 
            We have 
            \( ((h \circ g) \circ f)(x) = (b \circ f)(x) = b(f(x)) = h(g(f(x)) = h(a(x)) = (h \circ a)(x) =  (h \circ (g \circ f))(x).\)
            Thus composition is associative.
            Hence the set of all mappings from a given set to itself under the product of set composition is a semigroup ☯
        <p>
            Let \(S\) be the be the set of all one-to-one correspondences from a given set X to itself.  
            There exists a map \(e \in S\) such that \(e(a) = a\) for all \(a \in S\).
            Let \( \pi \) be any map in \(S\). By composition, \( (\pi \circ e)(x) = \pi(e(x)) = \pi(x) = e(\pi(x) = (e \circ \pi)(x)\)
            Thus group axiom (2) which is known as the identiy axiom is satisfied.
            A one-to-one correspondence is also known as a bijection. Bijections are invertible maps; i.e., for any map \(a \in S\) there exists a map \(a^{-1} \in Y\) such that \(aa^{-1} = e = a^{-1}a \).
            Thus group axiom (3) which is known as the inverse axiom is satisfied.  
            By the previous paragraph, associativity is inherieted.
            Hence the set of all one-to-one correspondences of a set with itself forms a group under composition ☯

            Let \(S\) be a semigroup with an element \(e\) such that \(ea=a=ae\) for all \(a \in S\).
            Suppose that there exists an element \(e' \in S\) such that \(ae' = a = e'a\).
            We have \( e = ee' = (ee')e = e'e = e' \). Hence the identity element is unique. ☯
        <p>    
            This indicates that the word "unique" in the identity axiom is superflous.

    <section class="theorem">
        <p>
            Let \(S\) be a semigroup with an element \(e\) such that \(ea = a\) for all \(a \in S\) and such that for every \(a \in S\) there exists \(a^{-1} \in S\) for which \(a^{-1}a=e\).
            We have \(a^{-1} = a^{-1}aa^{-1}\) and also \(e=(a^{-1})^{-1}a^{-1} \).
            By substitution, associativity, and the given properties: \(e=(a^{-1})^{-1}(a^{-1}aa^{-1}) =((a^{-1})^{-1}a^{-1})(aa^{-1}) = eaa^{-1} = aa^{-1}\).
            Thus we have both left and right inverses.
            Since we have \(a^{-1}a = aa^{-1} \), we are allowed \(ae = aa^{-1}a = ea\). Thus we have left and right identity. Hence \(S\) is a group. ☯

    <section class="theorem">
        <p>
            Let \(S\) be a semigroup with a finite number of elements. Suppose the right and left cancellation laws hold:
            if \(ab = ac\), or \(ba = ca\), then \(b=c\).
        Equivalently, if \(b \neq c \), then \(ab \neq ac\) and \(ba \neq ca\).
        Since there are exactly \(n\) distinct elements: \(x_1, ..., x_n \in\) \(S\), 
            there must be \(n\) distinct products: \( ax_1, \dots, ax_{n} \in S\), and also \( x_1a, \dots, x_{n}a \in S\).
        We must have \( \{ ax_1, \dots, ax_{n}\} = S = \{ x_1a, \dots, x_{n}a\}\) for each \( a \in S \).  
        Thus any two elements can be written such that one is the product of the other with some element \(x_i\) on the right or left.
        (This ensures every element has an inverse if we can show that \(S\) has identity.)
        By cancellation, \(x_{i}\) is unique.
        For any \(a \in S\), there is a unique \(e' \in S\) such that \(a=e'a\).
        Let \(c\) be a generic element \(\in S\). We have \(a=cx\) for exactly one \(x \in S\) and find that \((e'c)x = e'(cx) = e'a = a = cx\).
        By cancellation, \(e'c = c\). This shows that \(e'\) works as identity for any element \(\in S\) whatsoever. Thus \(S\) has identity: \(e = e'\) in the familiar notation.
        Hence \(S\) is a group. ☯

            Let \(G\) be a group. Define a new product operation on G by \(a*b := ba\) for any \(a,b \in G\). Let \(G^{*}\) denote the set G with the new product.
            We have assoacitivity: \((a*b)*c = (ba)*c = cba = a*(cb) = a*(b*c)\),
            identity is preserved: \(a*e = ea = a = ae = e*a \),
            and so are inverses: \(a*a^{-1} = a^{-1}a = e = aa^{-1} = a^{-1}*a\).
            Thus \(G^{*}\) satisfies the group axioms. ☯
        <p>
            \(G^{*}\) is known as the opposite group to \(G\).

            Let \(G\) and \(G'\) be groups. Define a new product on \(G \times G'\) by \((a,a')(b,b') := (ab, a'b')\).
            We have associativity: \(((a,a')(b,b'))(c,c') = (ac,a'b')(c,c') = (abc,a'b'c') = (a,a')(bc,b'c') = (a,a')((b,b')(c,c')))\),
                identity: \((e,e')(a,a') = (ea,e'a') = (a, a') = (ae, a'e) = (a,a')(e,e')\),
                and inverses: \((a,a')(a^{-1},a'^{-1}) = (aa^{-1}, a'a'^{-1}) = (e,e')\).
            Thus \(G \times G'\) is a group under the product. ☯
        <p>
            \(G \times G' \) is called the direct product of \(G\) and \(G'\).

            The first row and column show that \(e\) is the identity element.
            The diagonal shows that every element is its own inverse.
            Associativity is demonstrated as follows: \(e\) associates with anything since \(V\) is commutative; any product with three terms in which \(e\) is one of the terms is associative.
            For the same reason, any product with three non-distinct terms (i.e. two terms are the same, thus self-inverses) is associative.
            For any distinct \(x,y,z \in V\), none of which equal \(e\), \((xy)z = z^{2} = x^{2} = x(yz)\). Thus associativity is satisfied. V is so-called the four-group of Felix Klein.
